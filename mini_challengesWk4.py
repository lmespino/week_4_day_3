# Check if the word "beach" is not found in the following haiku. You should print the boolean.
# "Whitecaps on the bay:
# A broken signboard banging
# In the April wind."
# â€” Richard Wright, collected in Haiku: This Other World, 1998
Haiku = "Whitecaps on the bay: A broken signboard banging: In the April wind."
HasBeach = Haiku.find("Beach")
# words that aren't able to be found will be listed with a value of -1, which will be used in our boolean IF statement
if HasBeach == -1 :
    print("The word 'beach' is not in the Haiku")
